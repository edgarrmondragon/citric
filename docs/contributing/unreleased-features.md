# Unreleased Features

Citric supports LimeSurvey features that are not yet released and are sitting in the [`master`](https://github.com/LimeSurvey/LimeSurvey/tree/master) or [`develop`] branches of the LimeSurvey repository. These features must be decorated with [citric._compat.unreleased]`@unreleased` in order to be warn users that they are using a feature that is not yet released.

The `.. citric:unreleased-feature <next version>` directive will add a warning to the documentation.
